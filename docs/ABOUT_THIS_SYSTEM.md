# ABOUT_THIS_SYSTEM.md â€” TruEdgeâ„¢ RealSuite

Welcome to the cockpit-grade orchestration system that powers TruEdge. This document narrates the vision, architecture, and remixable philosophy behind the RealSuite monorepo.

---

## ðŸ§­ Vision

TruEdge is more than codeâ€”itâ€™s a compositional language for signal fusion, strategy execution, and intuitive visual feedback. Every module is designed to feel alive, adapting to market context and providing cockpit clarity.

---

## ðŸ§© Architecture Highlights

- **Modular Design** â€” Each repo is isolated, documented, and orchestration-safe
- **Cockpit Shells** â€” Toggleable overlays, diagnostics, and regime-aware filters
- **DropVault Presets** â€” Branded, scan/export-safe logic for public remix
- **FusionMaster.ts** â€” Central coordinator for signals, overlays, and diagnostics
- **RegimeBridge.ts** â€” Shared context for all modules

---

## ðŸ”— Remix Philosophy

- **Open-source by design** â€” MIT licensed, remixable, and extendable
- **Scan/export clarity** â€” All modules are built for deployment and scanning
- **Visual separation** â€” HUD overlays are toggle-safe and context-aware

---

## ðŸ§  System Behavior

- Modules pulse in sync with regime state
- Diagnostics route through `CockpitView.ts`
- Drops are injected via `DropManager.ts` and routed to `FusionMaster.ts`

---

## ðŸ§¬ Legacy & Community

TruEdge is evolving toward Medallion-style modular intelligenceâ€”where regime adaptation, pattern scoring, and visual overlays respond in real time. Whether youâ€™re remixing a module, forking a shell, or contributing a drop, welcome aboard.

This system lives, breathes, and evolves by orchestration.
