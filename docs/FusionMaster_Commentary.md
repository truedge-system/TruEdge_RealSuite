# FusionMaster Commentary
## A cockpit-grade narrative of real-time orchestration

FusionMaster coordinates the live behavior of core modulesâ€”signals, diagnostics, overlays, and regime syncâ€”across multiple timeframes and pattern classes. This commentary serves as the operatorâ€™s manual for understanding fusion logic and system behavior in context.

---

## ðŸ”„ Timeframe Sync & Signal Fusion

FusionMaster runs a multi-timeframe signal engine that fuses:

- **Primary Pulse Signals:** From `HarmonicPulse`, `PatternPulse`, and `FractalSync` layers
- **Regime-Aware Filters:** Supplied by `RegimeOverlay` modules (e.g. TrendState, VolatilityLens)
- **Contextual Overrides:** From `MLOverride` and `EventSync` classes

These signals are scored, merged, and ranked in the `FusionScore` engine, with real-time annotations in the cockpit shell.

---

## ðŸ§© Overlay Integration

All overlays feed FusionMaster with normalized states:

| Overlay Module       | Input Flow     | Cockpit Output              |
|----------------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| `HarmonicPulse`      | Pattern Type   | Signal ID + Validity Markers |
| `RegimeOverlay`      | Trend/Volatility | Filtered Enable Flags     |
| `DivergenceEngine`   | Strength Score | Confirmation Overlay         |
| `FractalSync`        | Resolution Lag | Layer Sync Marker            |

Toggle switches and overlay masks allow visual separation per module.

## ðŸ§  Commentary Labels

The cockpit shell displays live commentary such as:

- `ðŸŸ¢ Fusion Long Bias active (Regime OK, Pattern Confirmed)`
- `ðŸŸ¡ Divergence cross detected, awaiting TrendState`
- `ðŸ”´ FusionScore < 0.5 â€“ overrides on hold`

Each label is tied to a `DropClass` and visualized within `CockpitView`.

---

## ðŸ—‚ Commentary Sources

Signals and commentary are logged for:

- **Fusion Diagnostics** (`FusionScoreLog`)
- **Trade Setup Classifiers** (`DropClassManager`)
- **Module Tracebacks** (`FusionTraceShell`)

These can be used in live dashboards or exported for audit.

---

## ðŸ”§ Deployment Notes

- Ensure `FusionMasterShell` is toggle-safe and viewport-aware
- All commentary modules support multi-symbol, multi-timeframe routing
- Commentary can be scoped per viewport or per overlay fusion
